# discordbotlist

Easily add support for voting and display your bot's stats on [discordbotlist.com](https://discordbotlist.com) with just a few lines of code. This package provides support out of the box for [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) and [eris](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eris) bots, but can easily be adapted to work with any library of your choosing.

## Installation and Requirements

This package requires **Node 16** or newer. If you're using discord.js v14, you should already meet this requirement. Install discordbotlist using:

```
npm i --save discordbotlist
```

### Creating an API token

To post stats and fetch recent votes using this package, you'll need a discordbotlist API token. **This is not your Discord bot token. Do not use your Discord bot token as an API token or webhook secret.** To create an API token for your bot:

-   Visit its page on [discordbotlist.com](https://discordbotlist.com)
-   Locate the Admin section
-   Click "Generate Token"

### Setting up a Webhook Secret

To use webhooks, you will first need to create a Webhook Secret. **This is not your Discord bot token. Do not use your Discord bot token as an API token or webhook secret.** To configure your bot's Webhook Secret:

-   Visit its page on [discordbotlist.com](https://discordbotlist.com)
-   Click the "Edit" button
-   Enter a value in the Webhook Secret input and click "Edit"

## Creating a Client

For most, the easiest way to use this package will be by creating a client using the wrapper function for your library.

### Creating a Client (discord.js)

```ts
import { createDjsClient } from "discordbotlist";
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.on("ready", () => {
    const dbl = createDjsClient(DBL_API_TOKEN, client);
});

client.login(TOKEN);
```

### Creating a Client (eris)

```ts
import { createErisClient } from "discordbotlist";
import { Client } from "eris";

const client = new Client(TOKEN, { intents: ["guilds"] });

client.on("ready", () => {
    const dbl = createErisClient(DBL_API_TOKEN, client);
});

client.connect();
```

## Posting Bot Stats

After creating a client, you can start automatically posting your bot's stats to discordbotlist:

```ts
dbl.startPosting(/* optional interval, defaults to every hour */);
```

## Setting up Voting

This package can be used to implement voting by either exposing a webhook endpoint discordbotlist will call, or periodically checking for recent votes. The former is recommended in most cases and should be preferred if it can be used for your bot.

### Using Webhooks

This package provides [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) middleware that can be used to easily set up vote rewards using webhooks.

### Using Webhooks (with a Client)

After creating a dbl client, it can be used to set up vote rewards with an event-based interface:

```ts
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/dbl", dbl.webhook(DBL_WEBHOOK_SECRET));

dbl.on("vote", vote => {
    console.log(`${vote.username}#${vote.discriminator} voted!`);
});

app.listen(PORT);
```

### Using Webhooks (no Client)

If you don't want to use a client, you can use the `upvoteListener` function instead:

```ts
import { upvoteListener } from "discordbotlist";
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post(
    "/dbl",
    upvoteListener(DBL_WEBHOOK_SECRET, vote => {
        console.log(`${vote.username}#${vote.discriminator} voted!`);
    })
);

app.listen(PORT);
```

### Using Polling

If you're running in an environment where webhooks aren't suitable, you can also support voting by using polling. To use polling, call `Client#startPolling`, then listen for the `vote` event just like webhooks:

```ts
dbl.startPolling(/* optional interval, defaults to every five minutes */);

dbl.on("vote", vote => {
    console.log(`${vote.username}#${vote.discriminator} voted!`);
});
```

## Discord Bot List API

This package also provides a strongly typed interface for interacting with DBL's REST API if desired. All types and functionality for this API wrapper is accessible from `discordbotlist/api`. For example, to manually post a bot's stats without a Client instance:

```ts
import { postBotStats } from "discordbotlist";

postBotStats(DBL_API_TOKEN, DISCORD_BOT_ID, {
    guilds: 100,
    users: 1000,
});
```
